# project-one

For project One in the KU Bootcamp we were tasked with making a web application that utilizes 2 APIs.
OUr group decided to make an app that helps the user decide what and where to eat. 
The app would pull the users location and then pull restaurants near the user. 
The user can seach by really any food related category they would like. 
Once they choose the category they have the option to randomize the selection if they really cannot decide!

Our group utilized the Yelp API and APAPI and Google Maps
